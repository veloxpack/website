title: CSI Driver Rclone
description: Kubernetes CSI driver for mounting cloud storage backends using rclone.
---

## Overview

The Rclone CSI Driver enables Kubernetes to mount 50+ cloud storage backends as persistent volumes using rclone as a Go library. It provides seamless integration between Kubernetes storage and cloud providers without requiring external rclone binaries.

### Key Features

- **50+ Storage Providers**: Supports Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, Dropbox, SFTP, and many more
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses rclone as a Go library directly - no rclone binary installation required
- **No Process Overhead**: Direct library integration means no subprocess spawning or external process management
- **Dynamic Volume Provisioning**: Create persistent volumes via StorageClass
- **Secret-based Configuration**: Secure credential management using Kubernetes secrets
- **Inline Configuration**: Direct configuration in StorageClass parameters
- **Template Variable Support**: Dynamic path substitution using PVC/PV metadata
- **VFS Caching**: High-performance caching with configurable options
- **No Staging Required**: Direct mount without volume staging
- **Flexible Backend Support**: Choose between minimal or full backend support for smaller images

### Architecture

The driver implements the CSI specification with three main components:

- **Identity Server**: Plugin metadata and health checks
- **Controller Server**: Volume lifecycle management (create/delete)
- **Node Server**: Volume mounting/unmounting on nodes

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **No Staging**: Rclone volumes don't require staging
2. **Direct Rclone Integration**: Uses rclone's Go library directly
3. **Remote Creation**: Creates temporary remotes for each mount
4. **VFS Caching**: Leverages rclone's VFS for improved performance
5. **Template Variable Support**: Dynamic path substitution using PVC/PV metadata

### Supported Kubernetes Versions

| Driver Version | Kubernetes Version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| main branch | 1.20+ | GA |
| v0.1.0 | 1.20+ | GA |

### Requirements

- Kubernetes 1.20 or later
- CSI node driver registrar
- FUSE support on nodes (for mounting)
- **No rclone installation required** - uses rclone as Go library
